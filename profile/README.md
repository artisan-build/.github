# Artisan Build
## Crafting Revenue-Driven Solutions at Breakneck Speed

</div>

Artisan Build is the result of a highly compatible working partnership between industry veterans Len Woodward and Ed Grosvenor, bringing nearly three decades of combined expertise in PHP and Laravel development. We're not just developers; we're craftsmen who understand that in today's fast-paced business environment, **time-to-revenue** is the _critical_ metric that matters.

### Our Philosophy

> "Speed without quality is a recipe for technical debt. Quality without speed is a missed opportunity. We deliver both."

We've mastered the art of rapid development without compromising on code quality or maintainability. Our success is built on three core pillars:

- 🚀 **Lightning-Fast Iteration**
- 🏗️ **Battle-Tested Architecture**
- 💎 **Maintainable Solutions**

### The Artisan Advantage

What sets us apart is our innovative approach to development workflow. We've built our own ecosystem of tools and packages that enable unprecedented development velocity while maintaining the highest standards of code quality.

### Empowering the Developer Community

We believe in the power of community-driven development. **Every single one** our packages are **source-available**, enabling developers and agencies worldwide to:
