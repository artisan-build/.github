# Artisan Build  
> *Confident, expert leadership for Laravel applications, specializing in TALL stack and NativePHP.*

---

## 🌐 About Us  
Artisan Build works with top agencies and ambitious organisations to make Laravel development better for everyone.  
We provide steady, reliable engineering leadership, sharpen the workflow of development teams, and deliver practical, elegant solutions built on modern Laravel, the TALL stack, and NativePHP.

We focus on improving *how* teams build software, not only *what* they build, so delivery becomes calmer, faster, and more predictable.

## What We Do  

### 🧭 Fractional Team Leadership  
We step into existing engineering teams as technical leaders.  
We realign delivery, introduce clarity, stabilize processes, and help teams regain momentum with minimal disruption.

### 📦 Product & Stakeholder Management  
We bridge the gap between engineering and non-technical stakeholders to ensure the product solves the right problems at the right time.  
Clear requirements, prioritized backlogs, transparent roadmaps.

### 🧰 Tooling for Development Teams  
We provide tooling to help teams deploy more confidently:  
- visibility into technical health  
- structured workflows  
- process refinement  
- upcoming internal tools such as **Scalpels**, a small, sharp suite of tools for development teams.

### 🎓 Training & Mentorship  
We help juniors become seniors and seniors become leaders through practical training, pairing, workshops, and standards coaching.

### 🤖 Practical AI Integration  
We bring AI into engineering workflows where it genuinely helps teams; no hype, no gimmicks.  
A focus on automation, decision support, and technical-debt mapping.

### 🏗 Agency Overflow Support  
For agencies with too much work and too few hands: we join your team, use your tools, and deliver to your standards to close capacity gaps.

### 🚀 Co-Founder Support  
For founders with access to hungry markets:  we act as a technical co-founder, owning engineering while you own market development.

### 🔧 Ad Hoc Consulting  
We solve tough Laravel and product problems on a flexible basis: architecture, debugging, performance, team structure, or specific blockers.

### 🧹 Technical Debt Reduction  
A dedicated service for understanding and reducing technical debt.  
We use our own AI-assisted diagnostic approach to map out the issues, prioritise the work, and modernise legacy Laravel applications.

## Our Approach  

### 1. Discovery  
We analyse the product, the team, the workflow, and the biggest sources of friction.  
We pay attention not just to code, but to the emotional health of the team.

### 2. Integration  
We introduce tools, processes, and improvements gradually, without taking control away from the team or disrupting delivery.

### 3. Acceleration  
We align everyone on a clear product direction, improve velocity, raise quality, and build a calmer and more resilient engineering culture.
